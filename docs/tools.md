**Visual Studio Code** is a powerful, lightweight code editor. It has built-in support for many different programming languages with features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, error checking, and more.

It's highly customizable and has a large selection of extensions that add additional functionality (Including one for Bedrock Add-Ons).
